abstract = {Business Intelligence (BI) capitalized on datamining and analytics techniques for discovering trends and reacting to events with quick decisions. We argued that a new breed of data-mining, namely stream-mining where continuous data streams arrive into the system and get mined very quickly, stimulates the design of a new real-time BI architecture. In the past, stream-mining (especially in algorithmic level) and digital information system architectures have been studied separately. We attempted in this paper to present a unified view on the real-time BI system architecture powered by stream-mining. Some typical applications in which our architecture can support are described. {\textcopyright}2010 IEEE.},

abstract = {The primary purpose of business intelligence is to improve the quality of decisions while decreasing the time it takes to make them. Because focus is required on internal as well as external factors, it is critical to decrease data latency, improve report performance and decrease systems resource consumption. This article will discuss the successful implementation of a BI reporting project directly against an OLTP planning solver. The planning solver imports data concerning supply, demand, capacity, bill of materials, inventory and the like. It then uses linear programming to determine the correct product mix to produce at various factories worldwide. The article discusses the challenges faced and a working model in which real-time BI was achieved by providing data to a separate BI server in an innovativeway resulting in decreased latency, reduced resource consumption and improved performance. We demonstrated an alternative approach to hosting data for the BI application separately by loading BI and solver databases at the same time, resulting in faster access to information.},

abstract = {The article explores the business requirements for operational business intelligence (BI) and reviews different types of operational BI processing technologies and products that support those requirements. The objective of operational Bl is to make more timely business decisions, and, therefore, it has a close relationship to the subject of real-time or right-time BI processing. Information technology systems support three main types of application processing, business transaction processing (BTx), BI processing and collaborative processing. Operational Bl is not new--companies have been doing operational reporting for many years. When mainframes dominated the IT landscape, operational reporting consisted primarily of batch production reporting jobs that were run overnight against live BTx data to avoid affecting the performance of online BTx processing. Operational reporting applications simply format and display the content of BTx data stores. Many business users, however, want to},

An overview of some aspects of the area is presented in this article. The roots of BI and its usual associations with Knowledge Management Systems (KMS), Competitive Intelligence (CI), and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are introduced. From the literature review, it was observed that the definition of an underlying structure on the area is missing. Therefore, a framework for BI is defined.
