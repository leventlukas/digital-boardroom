abstract = {Business Intelligence (BI) capitalized on datamining and analytics techniques for discovering trends and reacting to events with quick decisions. We argued that a new breed of data-mining, namely stream-mining where continuous data streams arrive into the system and get mined very quickly, stimulates the design of a new real-time BI architecture. In the past, stream-mining (especially in algorithmic level) and digital information system architectures have been studied separately. We attempted in this paper to present a unified view on the real-time BI system architecture powered by stream-mining. Some typical applications in which our architecture can support are described. {\textcopyright}2010 IEEE.},

abstract = {In today's competitive environment, analysing data to predict market trends and to improve enterprise performance is an essential business activity. However, it is becoming clear that business success requires such data analysis to be carried out in real-time, and that actions in response to analysis results must also be performed in real-time in order to meet the rapid change in demand from customers and regulators alike. This paper discusses issues and problems of current business intelligence systems, and then outlines our vision of future real-time business intelligence. We present a list of emerging technologies that are being developed within the research program of British Telecommunications plc (BT), which could contribute to the realisation of real-time business intelligence, in addition to some examples of applying these technologies to improve BT's systems and services. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

abstract = {Operational risk is a function of the complexity of the business and the environment that the business operates in. Such complexities increase as the business or the environment become more dynamic, i.e. where change is a permanent feature and a factor to build into the management of the business. The key question that arises is how do businesses respond to such changes today and, if the nature of the business and the environment is becoming more and more dynamic, what actions can businesses take to predict and prepare for change. Viewed in this manner, operational risk becomes very closely related to the operational performance of the enterprise because it can be considered as dealing with changes that have a negative impact on the operational objectives. It is vital for enterprises to understand in real time how they are performing, and where on the spectrum of operational risk they are positioned. To accomplish this, it is essential to have a system for establishing the status of a business at any moment in time in relation to its performance objectives. This is the role of real-time business intelligence (RTBI), without which operational risk management could be out of date, or in some cases out of synchronisation with the business cycle, with serious consequences. This paper discusses the cornerstones of RTBI and demonstrates how these are also essential elements of an effective operational risk management framework. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2007.},

abstract = {The primary purpose of business intelligence is to improve the quality of decisions while decreasing the time it takes to make them. Because focus is required on internal as well as external factors, it is critical to decrease data latency, improve report performance and decrease systems resource consumption. This article will discuss the successful implementation of a BI reporting project directly against an OLTP planning solver. The planning solver imports data concerning supply, demand, capacity, bill of materials, inventory and the like. It then uses linear programming to determine the correct product mix to produce at various factories worldwide. The article discusses the challenges faced and a working model in which real-time BI was achieved by providing data to a separate BI server in an innovativeway resulting in decreased latency, reduced resource consumption and improved performance. We demonstrated an alternative approach to hosting data for the BI application separately by loading BI and solver databases at the same time, resulting in faster access to information.},

The objective of operational Bl is to make more timely business decisions, and, therefore, it has a close relationship to the subject of real-time or right-time BI processing. Information technology systems support three main types of application processing, business transaction processing (BTx), BI processing and collaborative processing. Operational Bl is not new--companies have been doing operational reporting for many years. When mainframes dominated the IT landscape, operational reporting consisted primarily of batch production reporting jobs that were run overnight against live BTx data to avoid affecting the performance of online BTx processing. Operational reporting applications simply format and display the content of BTx data stores. Many business users, however, want to},

BI enables business users to report on, analyze and optimize business operations to reduce costs and increase revenues. Organizations use BI for strategic and tactical decision making where the decision-making cycle may span a time period of several weeks (e.g., campaign management) or months (e.g., improving customer satisfaction).Competitive pressures coming from a very dynamic business environment are forcing companies to react faster to changing business conditions and customer requirements. As a result, there is now a need to use BI to help drive and optimize business operations on a daily basis, and, in some cases, even for intraday decision making.
